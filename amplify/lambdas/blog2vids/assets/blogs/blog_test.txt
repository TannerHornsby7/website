On a cold September Sunday, you make the trip to Costco to load up for the week. A rotisserie chicken for $5, 10lbs of grapes for $1, a 3pack of detergent for a quarter of the price of one at Walmart. It feels like you could buy anything and be getting a steal! But at the end of the day, u got around $100 to spend on food so ur card doesnâ€™t decline in front of the hot attendant. How do you decide what ur receipt will look like so that you make a good decision before the store closes?
